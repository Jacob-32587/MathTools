- This project is a suite of math tools to solve various problems. Version are formatted as
"MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION".  MAJOR release occur when 2 new tools are added OR a major change in made to the program. MINOR versions usually indicate a new tool has been added.  The 
REVISION usually represents small tweaks made to the programs internals

- The program consist of a "main menu" where a program can be selected from.  The main program (and any sub programs) can always be exited by entering "quit" as an input.

- V 1.0.0: Quadratic Formula and Base Conversion
In this release two math tools are excisable: 

"quad" -> Allows the user to calculate the roots of a quadratic by giving the 
coefficients and constant of any quadratic.  Works for imaginary numbers, and any coefficient inputs.

"base convert" -> Allows the user to convert from one base to another.  The radix of the input and output base must be in the bound of: [2,36].  The precession of a given floating point input/output is limited to 7 decimal place digits.
